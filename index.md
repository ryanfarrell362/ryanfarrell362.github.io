## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name's Ryan. I'm a 3rd year co-op student at the University of Guelph who just finished my first co-op at the University of Guelph working on the Global Burden of Animal Diseases project with my supervisor Deb Stacey. This report is a collection of my experiences during my 2 month co-op on the GBADs project.

## About GBADs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GBADs is a research initiative involving professors and researchers from across the globe to study the affect that animal disease outbreaks have on the economy of third world nations and what can be done to combat this. My team specifically was made up of two professors, a couple graduate level students and some co-op students such as myself who worked on items such as website design, plotting data from various sources, and designing apis to access this data.

## Job Description

My official task as a Data Programmer and Analyst on the GBADs informatics team was to develop the DDD-API-SDK. Known as the Deep Data Dive API Software Development Kit. In essence, this was a library written in Python with the task of making an easy to use library which could be used to interact with the various APIs of the data sources being used for the project and combining them into one system of api calls rather than having to learn the intricacies of many different systems in order to make calls to various data sources. While this was my main task over the two months of my co-op, I also spent time exploring the many data sources and writing up documents with information about the APIs of the data sources if they existed and how to access the data otherwise if APIs did not exist. I did this task first which helped get accustomed to the project and learn what it was all about.

## Acknowledgments

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to thank Deb Stacey for hiring me when I thought that summer coop postings were over and I'd have to lose out on a work term due to the pandemic. She took a chance on me when no one else would. I'd also like to thank my team for being great people to work with, especially Himmat who I worked closest with during my work term.
